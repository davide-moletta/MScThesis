\chapter{Real-Time Operating Systems}
\label{cha:rtos}

This project has been developed and tested on bare-metal applications to ensure
its correctness in simple environments. However, many embedded devices are
designed to accomplish more complex tasks and they need special environments to
support the execution. The purpose of this chapter is to provide insights into how
the project could be implemented to work with Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
to secure and support complex tasks and environments. Specifically, we provide an
implementation idea for two famous RTOSes, \textit{Free Real-Time Operating
System} (\textit{FreeRTOS}) and \textit{Zephyr RTOS}, depicting their strengths
and the limitations that may arise during implementation.

\section{FreeRTOS}
\label{sec:rtos_rtos}

\textit{FreeRTOS}\cite{freertos} is an open-source, lightweight, Real-Time Operating
System kernel designed for embedded systems. In recent years, \textit{FreeRTOS}
has become one of the most widely used \textit{RTOS} kernels in embedded applications,
particularly in microcontrollers, because of its efficiency, scalability, and portability.
\textit{FreeRTOS} is mostly used in applications that require reliable,
deterministic behavior in resource-constrained environments such as medical
devices, IoT devices, and automotive systems.

Among the many key features provided by \textit{FreeRTOS}, there are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-Time Scheduling: \textit{FreeRTOS} supports real-time scheduling with
    preemptive and cooperative multitasking. In preemptive scheduling, tasks are
    prioritized and can interrupt lower-priority tasks, while in cooperative
    multitasking, tasks yield control to others explicitly. Moreover, it uses priority-based
    scheduling, allowing developers to assign priority levels to tasks based on
    their timing requirements;

  \item Task Management: Tasks in \textit{FreeRTOS} are individual threads of execution,
    each with its stack and context. The kernel allows the creation, deletion, and
    management of tasks dynamically. Each task operates in its context, which the
    kernel saves and restores during context switching;

  \item Memory Management: \textit{FreeRTOS} provides several memory allocation schemes,
    including static and dynamic allocation, through its portable memory allocation
    subsystem. It supports different heap management schemes, offering varying levels
    of complexity and memory usage optimization. These schemes allow developers
    to balance between simplicity and flexibility;

  \item Interrupt Handling: \textit{FreeRTOS} is designed to work seamlessly with
    hardware interrupts, allowing Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) to
    communicate with tasks through mechanisms like queues and semaphores. The kernel
    offers a low-latency method for ISR handling, enabling efficient
    communication between ISRs and tasks while ensuring minimal delay in task
    scheduling;

  \item Software Timers: \textit{FreeRTOS} includes a timer API, allowing
    developers to create software timers that automatically trigger callback
    functions after a specified period. This feature helps to manage time-dependent
    operations without creating dedicated tasks;

  \item Portability and Scalability: \textit{FreeRTOS} is highly portable and can
    be adapted to run on numerous processor architectures, including \textit{ARM
    Cortex-M}, \textit{ARM Cortex-A}, \textit{RISC-V}, and various other
    architectures. It is structured in a way that allows developers to scale applications
    easily by adding or removing tasks, memory management schemes, and communication
    mechanisms as needed.
\end{itemize}

With all these features it is easy to see why \textit{FreeRTOS} has become a standard
in the community. However, \textit{FreeRTOS} presents some limitations like the
limited built-in security and the lack of support for multicore processing. Some
of these flaws have been addressed by community users and companies with alternative
versions of the Operating System. For example, \textit{Espressif} presented
\textit{IDF FreeRTOS}\cite{idfrtos}, a version of \textit{FreeRTOS} which
provides support for multicore processing. Moreover, \textit{high integrity
systems} developed \textit{SAFERTOS}\cite{safertos}, a redesign of the \textit{FreeRTOS}
kernel to enhance security.

Overall, \textit{FreeRTOS} is a powerful choice for developers working with embedded
systems that require real-time capabilities, low overhead, and efficient resource
management. Its design balances simplicity with flexibility, making it suitable for
a wide variety of applications from small IoT devices to more complex industrial
systems.

\section{Zephyr RTOS}
\label{sec:rtos_zephyr}

\textit{Zephyr RTOS}\cite{zephyrtos} is an open-source, Real-Time Operating System
designed for embedded systems and IoT applications. Developed under the Linux
Foundation, it offers a lightweight, modular, and scalable platform that supports
a wide range of devices, from simple microcontrollers to complex systems. Widely
adopted across IoT devices, industrial automation, medical equipment, and
automotive systems, \textit{Zephyr RTOS} excels in environments requiring
reliability, efficiency, and resource optimization.

\textit{Zephyr} is extremely scalable and modular. Its architecture enables
developers to include only the features they need, optimizing memory usage and performance
for resource-constrained devices. The kernel supports multiple configurations, making
it adaptable for both simple single-threaded tasks and advanced multi-threaded applications.
Additionally, \textit{Zephyr} is designed to deliver deterministic, time-critical
performance, ensuring minimal latency and high reliability.

\textit{Zephyr} includes advanced security features such as memory protection,
secure boot, and support for Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Regular updates
and audits ensure compliance with stringent security standards, making it a robust
choice for applications demanding high reliability and safety.

While both \textit{Zephyr RTOS} and \textit{FreeRTOS} are widely used in embedded
systems, they differ in their architecture, feature set, and target use cases. Firstly,
\textit{Zephyr} provides a comprehensive ecosystem out of the box, including
networking stacks, device drivers, and file systems. \textit{FreeRTOS}, in contrast,
offers a minimal kernel focused on task scheduling and real-time performance, with
additional features like networking provided as optional libraries. Moreover, \textit{Zephyr}
supports more complex applications, including those requiring multi-threading and
multicore systems, making it suitable for advanced IoT and industrial devices, while
\textit{FreeRTOS} is lightweight and optimized for simple real-time tasks on
resource-constrained microcontrollers. Lastly, \textit{Zephyr} offers built-in security
features while \textit{FreeRTOS} provides basic security features and relies on
external libraries for advanced functionalities.

Overall, with its lightweight design, real-time capabilities, and extensive ecosystem,
\textit{Zephyr RTOS} is a versatile platform for developers building secure,
scalable, and efficient embedded solutions.

\section{FreeRTOS and Zephyr RTOS Implementation}
\label{sec:rtos_porting}

In this section, we provide a detailed description of how \textit{FreeRTOS}
could be implemented to work inside the provided architecture and why this could
increase the scenarios in which it could be used. Note that we focus on the implementation
of \textit{FreeRTOS} but, most of the information provided in this section can be
applied to the implementation of \textit{Zephyr RTOS}. The same is true for the limitations
discussed in Section \ref{sec:rtos_limitations} as the RTOSes suffer from the same
implementation problem.

We have seen that the project is designed to enforce Control Flow Integrity on running
untrusted user code in bare-metal environments. However, given its simplicity,
it could be used to secure code in more complex environments, for example, with
a Real-Time Operating System like \textit{FreeRTOS}.

The main idea is to maintain the Control Flow Integrity enforcer as the M-mode operator,
managing system boot and edge controls. The user code, in this case, is represented
by the various tasks generated thanks to \textit{FreeRTOS}. Code instrumentation
would not change much as we would just need to add the \textit{regex} functions
to search for \textit{FreeRTOS}-specific instructions that cause a control transfer
during execution and inject the relative instructions. Finally, \textit{FreeRTOS}
could be used as a supervisor, either trusted or untrusted, depending on the
case. It would be in charge of managing task scheduling and memory operations.

Moreover, since \textit{FreeRTOS} requires its interrupt service routine, we
could either:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare two separate interrupt vector tables, one for the project\footnote{The
    same we have seen in Section \ref{sec:project_isr}.} and one for \textit{FreeRTOS}.
    However, traps at the user level are managed by default at the machine level
    so, if we have an interrupt or an exception in one of the tasks, the control
    is transferred to the project's interrupt vector table, and we must manually
    transfer the flow to the correct handler of the \textit{FreeRTOS} interrupt
    vector table. A solution to this could be to prepare two separate interrupt vector
    tables and use \textit{mideleg} and \textit{medeleg} registers (seen in
    Section \ref{subsec:riscv_deleg}) to automatically delegate some interrupts and/or
    exceptions to the \textit{FreeRTOS} interrupt vector table. For example, if
    we know that user interrupts are always managed by \textit{FreeRTOS} we could
    insert the corresponding code inside \textit{mideleg}. With this, each time
    a user-level interrupt is generated it is trapped at the \textit{FreeRTOS} interrupt
    vector table. Note that this does not mean that the Control Flow Integrity
    enforcer will not be able to manage those traps as higher-level interrupts
    and exceptions can't be delegated to the lower-level handler. For example,
    if a machine-level interrupt is generated, it will always be handled by the privileged
    interrupt vector table;

  \item Another solution would be to use only the project's interrupt vector table,
    specifying that \textit{FreeRTOS} should trap exceptions and interrupts at such
    table. This means that every time a trap is taken in \textit{FreeRTOS} the execution
    is transferred to the project's handlers. However, this may result in two unwanted
    situations. Firstly, handling all the traps inside the project's interrupt vector
    table may require many controls, and the code may become overly verbose. Secondly,
    this means that the traps that are generated in \textit{FreeRTOS} are handled
    in machine mode, and, for some environments, this could constitute a problem
    if we want to keep separation between privileges.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the integration of \textit{FreeRTOS} or \textit{Zephyr RTOS} into the
proposed architecture demonstrates a promising pathway to expand the system's applicability,
enabling robust real-time task management while maintaining critical security
assurances through Control Flow Integrity enforcement.

\section{Porting Limitations}
\label{sec:rtos_limitations}

The proposed implementation suffers from one key limitation, \textit{FreeRTOS} needs
to perform some operations on Control and Status Registers to function correctly
but, as we have explained, such registers are only available in machine mode.
Since the implementation would require \textit{FreeRTOS} to run either in supervisor
or user mode, all those operations would generate an illegal instruction
exception as those privilege modes can't access machine CSRs. The critical operations
on CSRs are depicted in Listing \ref{lst:freeoperations}.

To address this problem, we could enhance the instrumentation phase to modify
\textit{FreeRTOS}'s code in the following way. Firstly, we need to find the critical
instructions, which can be done easily with \textit{regex} functions. An example
of a \textit{regex} function to locate critical instructions is \textit{(csrr[wcs])$\backslash$s*([a-z0-9]+),$\backslash$s*([a-z0-9]+)}.
With this, we can extract the operation that \textit{FreeRTOS} is trying to perform
(among the one seen in Section \ref{sec:riscv_csrs}.), the target CSR, and the
value that is being written. Then, the target CSR can be translated thanks to
the table \textit{Currently allocated RISC-V machine-level CSR addresses}\footnote{Provided
by the \textit{RISC-V Privileged Manual}\cite{riscv} at page $17$.} where we can
see that for example register \textit{mstatus} is stored at address $0x300$. Now
we can precisely describe each target CSR, and we just need to inject new instructions
to perform an \textit{ECALL} to the project's interrupt vector table, which will
perform the modification of the CSRs on behalf of \textit{FreeRTOS}.

To do so, we can choose between two options. The first is to use register
\textit{a7} to hold the new \textit{ECALL} code which determines the operation
and three other registers, say \textit{a4}, \textit{a5}, and \textit{a6} to hold
the CSR number, the CSR instruction, and the value being written respectively. However,
this solution is highly inefficient in the use of registers since we could
encode those values into $3$ registers instead of $4$. Alternatively, we could
use register \textit{a7} to hold the new \textit{ECALL} code, register \textit{a6}
to hold the CSR number and the CSR instruction, and register \textit{a5} to hold
the value in case of writing or setting operations. Since there are $4$ CSR instructions
we just need $2$ bits to encode them, Table \ref{tab:instructionenc} depicts a
possible representation of the encodings of CSR instructions. All other bits would
be reserved to describe the target CSR for the operation. Note that CSRs
addresses go from $0x30 0$ up to $0xF15$ so, we need a maximum of $12$ bits to represent
each of them. Also, we can't encode the \textit{ECALL} code inside the same
register because we are using the least significant bit to represent forward and
backward edge controls, thus using it would result in ambiguity on the operation
to perform. \\

  \caption{CSR instructions encoding for \textit{FreeRTOS}}
  \label{tab:instructionenc}
\end{table}

Listing \ref{lst:csrinstrumentation} depicts the instrumentation needed to
correctly delegate the privileged instructions to M-mode. Say that we need to perform
the instruction \textit{csrrw mstatus, a0}, we know that \textit{mstatus} is
represented by $0x300$ and that the operation \textit{csrrw} is encoded as $00$.
Firstly, we load the value we want to write, which is stored in register \textit{a0}
into register \textit{a5}. Secondly, we load the value of the CSR into register
\textit{a6}. After that, we use an \textit{ori} instruction to set the most
significant bits depending on the CSR operation. For example, \textit{csrrc} is encoded
as $11$ so, we need to perform the \textit{or} operation with the value $0xC00000
00$. Lastly, we load into register \textit{a7} the \textit{ECALL} code that we want
to use to represent these types of calls. Once all the values are loaded, we can
perform the \textit{ECALL} instruction itself, the control will be transferred to
the correct handler, and the operation will be performed on behalf of \textit{FreeRTOS}.
As soon as the operation is handled, execution is resumed at the instruction that
was interrupted. Note that in the case of \textit{csrr} operations, we would
need to use a register to hold the value of the CSR. In this case, the
privileged handler would read the CSR and store its content inside register
\textit{a5} so \textit{FreeRTOS} should use such register to access the content
of the CSR after the \textit{ECALL} instruction. Figure \ref{fig:a6encoding} a
depicts a possible encoding for register \textit{a6} where we use the two most significant
bits to encode the CSR instruction we want to perform and all the other bits to represent
the target CSR. \\
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/freertos_encoding.png}
  \caption{Possible encoding for register \textit{a6}}
  \label{fig:a6encoding}
\end{figure}

Inside the interrupt vector table, we would just need to add an if statement to
determine if we are requesting to perform a CSR instruction on behalf of \textit{FreeRTOS}
based on the \textit{ECALL} code. \\ \begin{lstlisting}[style=Assembly, caption = \textit{FreeRTOS} instrumentation for Control and Status Register operations, label={lst:csrinstrumentation}]
mv a5, w_value     # Move the value to write into the CSR
la a6, csr         # Load the address of the target CSR
ori a6, a6, csr_op # Or with the encoding of the CSR operation
li a7, ecode       # Load the new ECALL value
ecall              # Perform the ECALL instruction
\end{lstlisting}

Note that this is just a proposal of implementation, and there are other ways to
implement \textit{FreeRTOS} within the project. For example, instead of encoding
the CSR instruction inside register \textit{a6}, we could define an \textit{ECALL}
code for each operation and simply use that value to determine the operation to perform.
This would result in fewer instructions to inject (as we could remove the \textit{ori}
instruction) but would increase the size of the handler as we would need to provide
controls for each implemented \textit{ecode}.
