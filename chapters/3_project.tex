\chapter{Control Flow Integrity Enforcer}
\label{cha:project}

In this chapter, we will see the project's goals and its design methodology. We
will also see the key aspects that allow to ensure Control Flow Integrity.

\section{Project Formalization}
\label{sec:project_formalization}

This project aims to enforce Control Flow Integrity on RISC-V-based microcontrollers.
The basic idea of the project is to be able to run code in User mode and ensure
that the expected execution path is followed. In other words, this project aims
at running User code securely, protecting it from attacks such as Arbitrary code
execution.

This project makes use of RISC-V capabilities like the PMP and state-of-the-art solutions
like a Shadow Stack and a Control Flow Graph to implement secure spaces of memory
to ensure the correctness of the policies.

\section{Project Specifics}
\label{sec:project_specifics}

In this Section, we will see the specifics of the project. All the development
has been made on Espressif's \textit{ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1} \cite{esp32c3} and the basic
configuration for bare-metal flashing is provided by Sergey Lyubka\cite{mdk}. Moreover,
the chosen ISA is the \textit{RV32imc\_zicsr}, where \textit{zicsr} is used to import
CSR instructions. Lastly, {riscv-unknown-gcc} toolchain has been used to cross-compile
the code. However, given the openness and modularity of RISC-V, any of these
settings can be modified according to one needs as the project has been
developed following the idea of RISC-V about hardware abstraction.

  {\scriptsize \parbox[t]{\linewidth}}
  \caption{Project working tree}
  \label{fig:workingtree}
\end{wrapfigure}

Figure \ref{fig:workingtree} depicts the working tree of the project, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item esp32c3 contains the boot configuration and the linker script;

  \item esputil contains Espressif's utils to manage the board;

  \item src/cfi/usercode contains the imported code that needs protection during
    execution;

  \item src/cfi contains the files used to implement the Shadow Stack, Control
    Flow Graph, interrupt vector table and machine setup;

  \item toolsExtra contains the Python files used to instrument and flash the code.
\end{itemize}

The scripts inside toolsExtra are used to compile, instrument, and run the code
(detailed description in Section \ref{sec:project_instrumentation}). Moreover,
the file \textit{CFGextractor.py} is used to extract a Control Flow Graph of the
code.

Inside src/cfi instead, we find the code responsible for managing the Machine
mode operations. File \textit{main.c} is responsible for setting up interrupts, managing
privilege modes, and setting up both the PMP (detailed description in Section \ref{sec:project_pmp})
and the interrupt vector table (detailed description in Section \ref{sec:project_isr}).
File \textit{intr\_vetor\_table.c} is responsible for managing interrupts and
exceptions as well as performing controls on both forward and backward checks (detailed
description in Section \ref{sec:project_controls}). Files \textit{cfg.c} and
\textit{shadow\_stack.c} hold the Control Flow Graph and the Shadow Stack respectively
(detailed description in Sections \ref{sec:project_cfg} and \ref{sec:project_ss}).
Lastly, \textit{ij\_logger.c} is used to retrieve indirect jump addresses thanks
to a logger.

\section{Code Instrumentation}
\label{sec:project_instrumentation}

Code instrumentation plays a critical role in this project as it allows to modification
of any code in a simple yet effective way. The whole instrumentation procedure
is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:instrumentation}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \def\stackalignment{r}\stackunder{ \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/instrumentation.png} } %
  {\scriptsize }
  \caption{Code Instrumentation Flow}
  \label{fig:instrumentation}
\end{figure}

We can run \textit{flasher.py} with four commands:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item build: builds the source files to produce the binary;

  \item run: builds and runs the binary on the board;

  \item secure-build: instrument and builds the source files to produce the
    secure binary;

  \item secure-run: instrument, builds, and runs the secure binary on the board.
\end{itemize}

If we choose to instrument the code with secure-build or secure-run commands the
following happens. All the source files are compiled into assembly files, then
the user files are passed to \textit{instrumenter.py}. Firstly, the code is instrumented
with logging capabilities to retrieve indirect jump destinations. This is done
by searching indirect jump instruction (defined as \textit{jalr} in RISC-V) and adding
the block of code depicted in Figure \ref{fig:loggingblock} before the jump.

\begin{wrapfigure}
  {r}{0.25\textwidth}
  \setlength{\intextsep}{0pt}
  \begin{minipage}{0.25\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=Assembly]

sw a1,16(sp)

sw s1,28(sp)
sw s2,32(sp)

lw s3,36(sp)
addi sp,sp,40
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Logging code block}
  \label{fig:loggingblock}
\end{wrapfigure}

This effectively allows us to save the state of the code and call the function
\textit{print\_reg} passing the destination address and the program counter of the
jump instruction as arguments. The function will then print a string such as
\textit{Source: 0x40380100 - Destination: 0x40380200}. After this
instrumentation, the assembly files are assembled and linked to produce the binary.
If there are indirect jumps in the code we perform a ``simulation'' of the
execution to retrieve the logging of the \textit{print\_reg} function.

After that \textit{CFGextractor.py} is called which extracts the Control Flow
Graph of the code. Once the CFG is extracted, it is injected into the code and
the true instrumentation is made.

Since we need to perform forward and backward controls we need to add code
blocks before every direct jump, indirect jump, and return instructions. To do so,
the assembly files are parsed, and, thanks to \textit{regex} functions we are able
to add the code we need.

Specifically, we need to add the code depicted in Figure \ref{fig:dirjumpblock}
before direct jumps (encoded as \textit{jal} in RISC-V). With this, we load the address
of the target function in register \textit{a7} and then we perform an ecall (detailed
functioning explained in \ref{sec:project_isr}).

For indirect jumps, we need to add the code depicted in Figure \ref{fig:indirjumpblock}.
With this, we can load the destination address (stored in target\_register) and perform
an ecall.

Lastly, for return instructions (encoded as \textit{ret} in RISC-V), we need to
add the code depicted in Figure \ref{fig:retblock}. With this, we can load the
return address (stored in return\_address\_register) and perform an ecall. In Section
\ref{sec:project_isr} we will see why, in this case, we need to add $1$ to the return
address.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Return code block}
  \label{fig:retblock}
\end{figure}

After this second instrumentation, the assembly files are assembled and linked to
produce the secure binary file, which is taken from \textit{flasher.py} and run on
the board.

\section{Interrupts Service Routine}
\label{sec:project_isr}

In this section, we will see how interrupts and exceptions are handled in this project.
Most importantly we will see how forward and backward edge controls are enforced.

The interrupt vector table is defined inside \textit{intr\_vector\_table.c}. As
already explained its address is loaded in \textit{main.c} and stored inside mtvec
(\ref{subsec:mtvec}) with MODE set to Vectored. This means that every
asynchronous interrupt will set the program counter to the base address of the
vector table plus $4$ times the cause of the interrupt. Any other interrupt and exception
is trapped inside the function \textit{synchronous\_exception\_handler} which
redirects to the correct function depending on the trap cause.

Since ecalls are defined as exceptions in RISC-V, the interrupt vector table is responsible
for managing them. However, since ecalls can be used for different purposes they
are designed to be expandable. Table \ref{tab:ecalls} depicts the current
allowed ecalls.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Code} & \textbf{Use}     & \textbf{Description}                  \\
    \hline
    1             & Reserved         & Used to terminate execution           \\
    \hline
    address       & Forward control  & Used to check the destination address \\
    \hline
    address + 1   & Backward control & Used to check the return address      \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Encoding of current Ecall values}
  \label{tab:ecalls}
\end{table}

This design has been used to minimize the use of registers. Another solution
would have been to use a register, say \textit{a7}, to hold the ecall code, and
another register, say \textit{a6}, to hold the address to check. However, since addresses
must be even we can encode in one register both the value of the ecall code and the
address (Figure \ref{fig:ecall} shows the encoding of register \textit{a7}). When
the interrupt vector table has to check which code is used we can just see if the
value in \textit{a7} is even or odd and, depending on the result we can decide what
operation to perform (even values will lead to a forward check while odd values
will lead to a backward check). When we need to check for a return address we
first subtract $1$ from it to obtain the original value of the address.

Note that the use of register \textit{a7} for ecalls is purely a design choice and,
to ensure that such register is not tampered with by the compiler it has been ``disabled'',
meaning that the compiler will never use such register. This choice allows us to
be sure that only the interrupt vector table and the code blocks that we inject
modify the value of \textit{a7}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \def\stackalignment{r}\stackunder{ \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/ecall_code.png} } %
  {\scriptsize }
  \caption{Encoding of register a7 during ecall}
  \label{fig:ecall}
\end{figure}

To add new custom ecall codes we just need to put a control before we check if
the code is even or not. Say that we want to add code $2$ to perform a specific operation.
To do so, we just need to add a check like \textit{if(code == 2) $\rightarrow$
perform operation}, if the check fails the code will eventually check if the code
is even or not and perform the corresponding control.

This implementation of the interrupt vector table effectively helps to implement
the desired controls while leaving space for future functionalities.

\section{Shadow Stack}
\label{sec:project_ss}

The file \textit{shadow\_stack.c} holds the configuration for the Shadow Stack.
The development of the Shadow Stack took inspiration from the formally verified
idea proposed by Matthieu Baty, Guillaume Hiet, and Pierre Wilke in their
article \textit{Work in progress: A formally verified shadow stack for RISC-V} \cite{shadowstack}.

The Shadow Stack is implemented as a standard Last-in-first-out stack (LIFO).
This is because the last jump that is performed in a code will always be the
first to return. This allowed us to build an effective and fast data structure that
consumes a small amount of memory.

The Shadow Stack allows two operations, \textit{push} and \textit{pop}. \textit{Push}
is used when a direct or indirect jump is made. If such a jump is considered legal,
its return address is pushed into the Shadow Stack and stored for later. Instead,
\textit{pop}, is used when a return is made. An address is \textit{popped} from
the Shadow Stack and a match between the popped value and the current return
address is made to decide whether the return instruction is legal or not.

\section{Control Flow Graph (CFG)}
\label{sec:project_cfg}

The Control Flow Graph of the binary is extracted during the instrumentation phase.
As we have seen, if there are indirect jumps the script performs a simulation run
to retrieve source and destination addresses of each indirect jump. If there is
a simulation, the output is parsed to store the addresses in a list. After that,
the static extraction begins, in which we examine the dump file of the binary to
retrieve the source and destination addresses of each direct call. After all the
addresses have been gathered, the lists are ordered and injected in the file
\textit{cfg.c} which holds the configuration for the Control Flow Graph.

In this file, we can see the structure of the Control Flow Graph which is an
array where each position is occupied by a pair \textit{source-destination}.
Since the CFG will not change during execution we can define it statically and
provide no functions to add or remove elements. The only available function is \textit{check}
which asks for a pair of addresses as input and determines whether such a pair
is part of the CFG or not. The check is implemented using a binary search function
and the comparison is made using the function depicted in Figure \ref{fig:binsearch}.
With this function, the binary search first searches for the source address and,
only when found it searches for the destination address.

This implementation of the Control Flow Graph effectively reduces space
consumption to the bare minimum while providing a fast checking method ($\mathcal{O}
(\log{n})$). Another solution could be to use a Hash Table to store the addresses.
In this case, we would reduce the time required to access the CFG to $\mathcal{O}
(1)$. However, this works only with big enough Hash Tables, otherwise, we could face
many collisions, and the time required to find the correct entry would increase.
Still, this alternative solution could be perfect for situations in which we
care more about time than space.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
int compare(const int* A, const int* B) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    if (A[i] < B[i]) return -1;
    if (A[i] > B[i]) return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
 \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Comparison for binary search}
  \label{fig:binsearch}
\end{figure}

\section{Physical Memory Protection (PMP)}
\label{sec:project_pmp}

In this project, the role of the PMP is to protect the Shadow Stack and the Control
Flow Graph from unauthorized modifications. To ensure that both these data
structures are secured four memory regions have been created. Each region's configuration
can be seen in Table \ref{tab:pmpregions}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Region Start}           & \textbf{Region End}           & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Privileges} \\
    \hline
    0x00000000                      & End of .sdata region          & TOR           & R-W                 \\
    \hline
    Start of interrupt vector table & End of interrupt vector table & TOR           & R-W-X               \\
    \hline
    Start of Shadow Stack           & End of Control Flow Graph     & TOR           & R-W                 \\
    \hline
    Start of main                   & 0x90000000                    & TOR           & R-W-X               \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{PMP memory regions}
  \label{tab:pmpregions}
\end{table}

The first region covers all the space between 0x00000000 and the end of the .sdata
region with read and write privileges, since this region contains only static data
there is no need to allow execution.

The second region covers the interrupt vector table and its functions, since
this region is accessed only in Machine mode and we need to execute instructions
we need to provide read, write, and instruction execution privileges.

The third region is the one that covers both the Shadow Stack and the Control
Flow Graph. For this reason, we need to restrict privileges to read and write. We
can't set this region as read-only since we need to modify the Shadow Stack during
execution.

The last region covers all the addresses from the start of the main function up to
the end of the memory. This region also includes user code and, since we need to
execute the code, we need to configure this region with read, write, and
instruction execution privileges.

This PMP configuration effectively helps to prevent unauthorized modifications
to critical components such as the Shadow Stack and the Control Flow Graph. Thanks
to this, we are sure that whatever value we read from these data structures will
be safe and trustable.

\section{Forward and Backward Edge Controls}
\label{sec:project_controls}

The most critical part of this project is about validating jump and return instructions
and this is done inside the interrupt vector table.

Forward edge controls are made thanks to the Control Flow Graph while backward edge
controls are made thanks to the Shadow Stack.

In this section, each control will be carefully explained to show how they work
and why they provide a certain degree of security.

\subsection{Forward Edge Controls}
\label{subsec:forward}

To perform a forward edge control we need three things. The first is the source
address, the second is the destination address, and the third is an oracle that
tells us if the pair source-destination is valid. As already explained the destination
address is retrieved from \textit{a7} which is passed as the ecall code. The source
register instead can be retrieved from mepc \ref{subsec:mepc}. As we have seen, when
a trap is taken mepc holds the address of the instruction that was interrupted.
Since the ecall generates the trap we can just add $4$ (size of the ecall) to
the address stored in mepc to retrieve the source address. Now that we have the pair
of addresses to check we can use the Control Flow Graph as the oracle. As
already explained, the CFG is computed before compilation and is securely stored
in a safe memory region so we can consider it as a trusted oracle.

So, when we need to perform a forward edge control, we can just send the source and
destination addresses to the \textit{check} function of the CFG. Such function performs
a binary search inside the CFG to see whether that specific pair is part of the original
CFG. If the search succeeds the function returns a positive value and the jump
is considered legal while, if the search does not succeed the instruction is aborted
and the execution terminates to prevent any possible damage.

Whenever a forward edge control succeeds we know that the related jump instruction
will eventually return so we need to store its return address inside the Shadow Stack.
To do so, we need to retrieve the return address but, since a call will always
return to its next instruction, we can just compute $source \ address + 2$ (size
of \textit{jal} and \textit{jalr}) to retrieve it. After that, the address is pushed
into the Shadow Stack, and the execution is resumed with the interrupted jump
instruction.

\subsection{Backward Edge Controls}
\label{subsec:backward}

To perform a backward edge control we need two things. The first is the
destination address and the second is an oracle that tells us if such address is
valid. As we have seen, the destination address is retrieved from \textit{a7} which
is passed as the ecall code. In this case, the oracle is the Shadow Stack.

So, when we need to perform a backward edge control, we can just pop an address from
the Shadow Stack and match the destination address with the popped one. If the
addresses are the same we consider the return instruction legal while, if they are
different the execution is terminated.

Whenever a backward edge control succeeds we must do nothing since the value has
already been removed from the Shadow Stack and no other modifications are needed.
Thus, the execution is resumed with the interrupted return instruction.

\section{Proof of Concept (PoC)}
\label{sec:project_poc}

In this section, we will see why the proposed solution effectively provides security
capabilities to a non-trusted and insecure code. Figure \ref{fig:functioning}
depicts an abstraction of the project's flow.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \def\stackalignment{r}\stackunder{ \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/functioning.png} } %
  {\scriptsize }
  \caption{Abstraction of the flow of execution}
  \label{fig:functioning}
\end{figure}

We have already seen that the \textit{Boot and Startup} and \textit{Machine code
init} sections are used to configure the board and the machine configuration respectively.
This part of the code is trusted so we are sure the machine will be configured
properly. The only way to corrupt this part of the execution would be to modify the
source code before compilation but, this is out of the project's scope.

The same is true for the \textit{CFI Enforcer} section which is responsible for managing
edge controls as well as other interrupts and exceptions. Even in this case, the
source code has to be modified to tamper with the security features.

On the other hand, the \textit{User code} section is untrusted and we can't make
any assumptions on its functioning. The code could be well-written and somewhat
secure but it could be full of flaws and we must prevent any attack that could
be perpetrated through it. To do so, we use forward and backward edge controls
together with the Shadow Stack and the Control Flow Graph.

As already said, the Shadow Stack and the CFG are the most critical points of the
project. We must secure them since they serve as oracles and we must be able to
trust the data they contain. Since the CFG is configured statically we are sure that
it can't be modified during execution, the Shadow Stack instead is designed to
change since we need to push and pop values from it. However, since we protected
the Shadow Stack with the PMP we can be sure that only privileged code has
access to it and any other access generates a trap that is handled through the
interrupt vector table. This means that, even if one tries to add or remove
values from the stack the operation will be aborted immediately and our trust in
the Shadow Stack remains intact.

Now we will go through every possible scenario that could happen during a normal
execution.

As soon as a forward edge control is requested we check that the pair source-destination
is valid thanks to the CFG. Let's say that an attacker tampered with the code to
perform an unauthorized jump, in this case, the CFG will not contain such a pair
since we said that it can't be modified. In this case, the unauthorized jump is detected
and the code terminates immediately. Instead, if the pair is legal according to the
CFG the jump is considered safe and the return address is pushed into the Shadow
Stack. Note that since we compute the return address each time instead of
trusting the one provided by the user code we are sure that the value inserted
in the stack is correct and we can trust it.

If a backward edge control is requested instead, we check that the return address
provided by the user code is the one we are expecting by popping the last value that
was inserted in the Shadow Stack. Again, let's say that an attacker tampered with
the code to perform an unauthorized return, in this case, the addresses will not
match and the execution is terminated. Note that the fact that we can trust the
Shadow Stack is highly dependent on the configuration of the PMP. This is because,
without a proper configuration, it would be possible for an attacker to push a value
into the Shadow Stack and then tamper with the return address to effectively return
to an unauthorized address.

Moreover, when we try to push a value into a full Shadow Stack the execution is
terminated. This is needed because if we are not able to push the address into the
Shadow Stack we will not be able to make the next backward edge control and thus,
the security would be compromised. Note that the same happens when we try to pop
a value from an empty Shadow Stack since this means that we are checking a return
instruction that was never meant to be performed.

Lastly, we could design the enforcement of the backward edge controls in another
way. If we need to control a return address and there is a mismatch we could force
the user code to return to the address stored in the Shadow Stack which we know is
safe. While this solution enforces Control Flow Integrity securely we can't be
sure that the stack (referring to the normal stack used to store registers) has
not been compromised and thus, terminating execution is a much safer choice.

So, we have seen that this project effectively enforces Control Flow Integrity
on an untrusted user application and that its security functionalities work as
expected to prevent any attempt to perform unauthorized operations.
