\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

This chapter serves as an introduction to \textit{STEERED}, a new security
infrastructure for \textit{RISC-V}-based embedded devices. The proposed solution
aims at addressing security flaws in current microcontrollers that use this new
Instruction Set Architecture.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:intro_context}

Embedded devices are now an integral part of daily life, powering a wide range
of applications that span from smart home assistants and appliances to connected
furniture. These compact computing units have expanded across numerous domains,
supporting diverse tasks that enhance convenience, efficiency, and connectivity
in everyday environments. A defining feature of embedded devices is their network
connectivity, which links them to the broader Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.
According to the ``\textit{State of IoT Summer 2024}'' report, $16.6$ billion devices
were connected by the end of $2023$, a figure expected to rise to $18.8$ billion
during $2024$\footnote{\url{https://iot-analytics.com/number-connected-iot-devices/}}.
These devices perform critical functions across industries ranging from consumer
electronics to industrial automation and healthcare but they are often resource-constrained
and designed to perform specific tasks with minimal power and computational
resources, making them inherently vulnerable to cyber threats. In $2022$, approximately
$112$ million IoT cyberattacks were reported globally\footnote{\url{https://1nce.com/en-us/resources/news/blog/iot-cybersecurity-landscape}},
and this figure continues to escalate, with the first half of $2024$ witnessing
a $107\%$ increase in attacks as highlighted by \textit{SonicWall}'s ``\textit{2024
Mid-Year Cyber Threat Report}''\footnote{\url{https://www.sonicwall.com/threat-report}}.
Consequently, embedded device security is an increasingly pressing concern, as
attacks on these devices can result in data breaches, unauthorized system control,
or disruptions to essential services.

Among the potential threats, we have Software-based, Network-based, and Side-based
attacks that an attacker may use to impact Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
of a system. For example, with a \textit{Man-In-The-Middle} (MITM) attack, an actor
could gain access to cryptographic keys and steal sensitive information.
Moreover, if an attacker manages to take control of many devices, creating what
is known as a \textit{Botnet}, he could use such devices to perpetrate \textit{Denial
of Service} (DoS) attacks to external systems.

With all these information it is easy to understand why embedded devices have become
a suitable target for cyber attacks and why this is a security concern. It would
be relatively ``easy'' to think of implementing state-of-the-art security
solution to protect these devices, however, the problem is that many of them
have limited hardware resources as they may be designed to carry out simple
tasks. This means that we must apply security measures that are within the device's
capabilities without affecting its performance. This truly is a challenge
because, in specific cases, there may be the need to design tailored security
features to protect device-specific components.

\section{Goals}
\label{sec:intro_goals}

In this thesis, we introduce \textit{STEERED} (Secure Trusted Execution
Environment for \textit{RISC-V}-based Embedded Devices), an which incorporates Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) to safeguard the control paths within embedded \textit{RISC-V}
systems. This mechanism utilizes a lightweight CFI enforcer, specifically
designed to be compatible with the limited resources of RISC-V microcontrollers.
By integrating structures such as a Shadow Stack and Control Flow Graph (CFG),
\textit{STEERED} ensures that only authorized execution flows occur, thereby
blocking potential control-flow hijacking attempts without compromising device
performance.

Following this introduction, Chapter $2$ presents the foundational concepts of the
\textit{RISC-V} Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), essential for understanding the
architectural basis of the project. Chapter $3$ details the implementation
specifics of \textit{STEERED}'s infrastructure, discussing critical features
such as forward and backward edge control mechanisms and the use of Physical
Memory Protection (PMP) to create secure memory spaces. To validate the effectiveness
of \textit{STEERED} in real-world scenarios, Chapter $3$ also introduces a Proof
of Concept (PoC). This PoC will exemplify how the project addresses critical
security threats, illustrating its impact on device resilience and system integrity.
A subsequent threat analysis will examine the types of attacks the project is
designed to defend against, assessing its effectiveness and identifying any potential
vulnerabilities that may need further consideration. A performance analysis is
also provided, where the trade-offs between security and system efficiency are evaluated.
This analysis will help highlight the strengths and limitations of the project
and explain why it represents a feasible solution for enhancing the security of
embedded devices.

Finally, the thesis explores the potential integration of \textit{FreeRTOS}, a widely-used
Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for embedded devices, into \textit{STEERED}.
This integration could extend the project's applicability, enabling more complex
programs to operate within the secure environment provided by the infrastructure.
By supporting an established OS like \textit{FreeRTOS}, the project could
broaden its reach and utility, making it suitable for a larger variety of use cases
in the embedded device domain.

In summary, this thesis presents a novel approach to securing \textit{RISC-V} microcontrollers,
leveraging Control Flow Integrity to protect against control-flow attacks and
providing a secure foundation for running potentially unsafe code. Through detailed
technical exploration, demonstration, and analysis, this work aims to contribute
a significant advancement to the field of embedded device security, addressing both
current and emerging threats in the IoT landscape.
